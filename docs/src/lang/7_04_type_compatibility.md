# Type compatibility
Type compatibility is very close to automatic or implicit type conversion. The type compatibility is being able to use two types together without modification and being able to subsititute one for the other without modification.

Compatible types are:
- `int` (and its subtypes like `uint8`,etc) and `float`.
- `int`(and its subtypes like `uint8`,etc) and `double`.
- `float` and `double`

**Note: strings are not compatible with characters.**
